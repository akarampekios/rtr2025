# Project Status Overview

## Original Vision

**Refined Implementation Plan (4-5 Weeks)**

**Week 1 – Foundation & Basic Rendering**  
- Goals: Get basic scene rendering working.  
- Days 1-2: Project setup with Auto-VK, CMake, basic window.  
- Days 3-4: Asset pipeline (Blender → glTF → Auto-VK loading).  
- Days 5-7: Basic forward rendering pipeline, simple city geometry.

**Week 2 – Ray Tracing & Lighting**  
- Goals: Implement core ray tracing and lighting systems.  
- Days 1-3: Ray tracing pipeline setup, acceleration structures.  
- Days 4-5: Basic ray-traced reflections.  
- Days 6-7: Neon lighting system, emissive materials.

**Week 3 – Volumetric Effects & Vehicle**  
- Goals: Add volumetric lighting and vehicle movement.  
- Days 1-3: Volumetric lighting implementation.  
- Days 4-5: Vehicle system with predefined circular path.  
- Days 6-7: Camera following system, smooth movement.

**Week 4 – Polish & Optimization**  
- Goals: Post-processing and performance tuning.  
- Days 1-3: Post-processing pipeline (bloom, tone mapping, color grading).  
- Days 4-5: Performance optimization, LOD system.  
- Days 6-7: Final polish, demo recording setup.

**Week 5 – Buffer & Presentation**  
- Goals: Final testing and presentation preparation.  
- Days 1-3: Bug fixes, performance tuning.  
- Days 4-5: Demo script, camera angles, recording.  
- Days 6-7: Presentation preparation, documentation.

### Technical Architecture (Original)
- **Auto-VK:** Vulkan abstraction and asset loading.  
- **GLM:** Mathematics library.  
- **ImGui:** Debug UI and controls.  
- **GLFW:** Window management.  
- **stb_image:** Texture loading.

**Rendering Pipeline**  
- Forward pass: City geometry with basic lighting.  
- Ray tracing pass: Reflections and global illumination.  
- Volumetric pass: Light shafts and fog.  
- Post-processing: Bloom, tone mapping, color grading.

**Performance Targets**  
- 60 FPS @ 1080p on RTX 30 series.  
- Ray tracing: 1 bounce for reflections.  
- Volumetric: 32 samples per pixel.  
- Geometry: ~50-100 buildings max.

**Key Implementation Details**  
- Asset Pipeline: Blender export to glTF 2.0 with PBR/emissive materials, Auto-VK loading.  
- Ray Tracing: Screen-space + ray-traced hybrid reflections, single bounce GI, RTX denoising.  
- Volumetric Lighting: God rays from neon lights, atmospheric fog with temporal accumulation.

## Current State (October 2025)
- Vulkan-based application boots via `Application` and `SimpleRenderer`, rendering a procedurally generated or glTF-loaded cyberpunk scene.  
- Ray tracing pipeline compiles and runs; console output verifies acceleration structure rebuilds, ray dispatch, and swapchain presentation.  
- Camera supports first-person flight controls (WASD + mouse) with basic movement logic.  
- Scene loader stubs out GLTF parsing but provides procedural geometry and animated emissive materials.  
- Shader management loads SPIR-V artifacts generated at build time; CMake targets compile ray tracing shaders automatically.  
- Build system: CMake + Visual Studio 2022, confirmed Release build succeeds.  
- README and `.gitignore` updated to document setup, runtime instructions, and repository hygiene.

## Next Steps
- **Finalize Asset Pipeline:** Replace GLTF stubs with real parsing and integrate Auto-VK loading if still planned.  
- **Volumetric Effects:** Implement volumetric lighting pass and fog accumulation per the original Week 3 goals.  
- **Vehicle & Camera Systems:** Add moving vehicle pathing and cinematic camera follow behavior.  
- **Post-Processing Suite:** Bring in bloom, tone mapping, and color grading to match Week 4 targets.  
- **Performance Tuning:** Address compile-time warnings, optimize ray tracing workloads, and validate 60 FPS on target hardware.  
- **Presentation Prep:** Script demo beats, capture footage, and polish documentation for Week 5 milestones.
